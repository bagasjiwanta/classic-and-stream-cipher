In this project, we make ciphers with UI. Built with Nextjs only.

## Classical Cipher
  - Vigenere cipher: cipher by addition/subtraction between key and plaintext
  - Extended vigenere cipher: vigenere cipher with extended vocabulary (0-255 ascii string). Also could take file as input
  - Playfair cipher: transposition cipher using 5x5 square key
  - One time pad: one time generation (random key)
 
## Stream cipher
RSA with 2 modifications to make it more secure:
  - Dropping the first 256 prga but still mixing the state
  - Adding a LFSR layer to add more randomness
